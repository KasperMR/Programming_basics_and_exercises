Console.WriteLine("You can ask a programming language a yes no question in the form of a boolean statement.");
Console.WriteLine("There are 5 ways to compare two things in programming: ==, >, >=, <, <=");
// == demands that both sides are equal to each other
// > and < are the same as we use in math, one side being greater than the other. This can also be used to compare other things than numbers, such as text
// <= and >= work the same as above, however they also allow the sides to be equal to each other.
Console.WriteLine();

//This is the simplest form of a boolean statement, where we only want to do anything when the statement is true
if(1 == 1)

//EXERCISES

//1
//using Console.WriteLine ask the user if they would like ice cream, recieve the users answer with Console.ReadLine, save the answer in a variable, 
// and respond according to their answer


//2
//make an if statement that determines if the random number is under or over 50. Below i have set up a random number generator for you.
Random rnd = new Random(); //starting up the random number generator
int number = rnd.Next(0, 100); //generating a random number from 0 to 99, note that 100 is excluded

//3
//calculate total amount to pay to buy something
//make a variable with the price of the object
//if the price is under 50, no tax,
//over 50 and under 2000, 20% tax
//over 2000, 25% tax
//save the result in a new variable and write it to the console.
